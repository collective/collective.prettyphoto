Changelog
=========

0.4.1 (2011-03-22)
------------------

- Upgraded to prettyPhoto 3.0.3 .
  This fixes thumbnails in overlay_gallery partly because the regular expression
  now looks for a (jpg|jpeg|png|gif) within the whole url. if your originaly
  linked images are completely without this, they still wont show up.
